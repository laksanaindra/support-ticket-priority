Support Ticket Priority Prediction with Machine Learning

One of the biggest challenges in customer support is manually determining ticket priority, which often causes delays in resolving critical issues.

In this project, I built a Machine Learning model to automatically predict support ticket priority (Low, Medium, High).

üîç Highlights & Results:

Dataset: 50K support tickets from Kaggle, 33 features (customer sentiment, tier, downtime, etc.).

EDA: High-priority tickets are often linked to premium customers, longer downtimes, and higher error rates.

Modeling: XGBoost outperformed Random Forest with 97% accuracy and 0.95 recall for High Priority tickets, reducing the risk of misclassifying critical cases.

Recommendations: automate escalation for High-priority tickets, monitor SLA compliance, and focus on premium customers.

üìä Tools used: Python (EDA, modeling, evaluation), Streamlit (app demo), GitHub (code management).

‚ú® Value of this project:
It demonstrates how data science can enhance customer support efficiency, reduce delays in handling critical issues, and help businesses focus on high-value customers.
